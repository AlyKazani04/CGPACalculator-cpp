## About the Project
- Terminal-based CGPA Calculator, requires the user to input the grades, along with credit hours, for each course in the semester, for all the semesters the user has completed.

## Running the project
- Since I have statically linked all the necessary files need to run this program, all you need is the exe file that you can find in [Releases](https://github.com/AlyKazani04/CodeAlpha_CGPACalculator/releases).
- Click on the exe to start calculating your cgpa.

> [!NOTE]
> For ungraded course the user may be required to enter 4 gpa with 1 credit hours, to get an accurate result (since some universities don't entirely ignore non-credit courses).
> I noticed this when testing the calculator and comparing with my own GPA.
